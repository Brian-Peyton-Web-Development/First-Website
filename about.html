  <h2>I enjoy traveling, exercise, and hanging out with family and friends.</h2>
  <img src="" alt="me doing stuff">
  <p>I've driven across America 12 times, 11 of them solo.  I've covered ground from Key West, FL to Toronto, Canada. <br>
    <br>
  I've made it from San Diego to Seattle by car as well.  I've made tracks from Homer to Fairbanks, AK. <br>
    <br>
  I am comfortable driving "European Style," where the steering wheel and flow of traffic are on opposite sides. <br>
    <br>
  I've put over 100,000 miles on my car in less than 2 years, many of them while driving for Uber.
